 * 
 * if we try to read a line example : "hello world from test file"
 * 
 * with ou buffer size = 5, on the first try we will read only "hello"
 * and then we verify if we are in the end of the line ? if not we will call it again and join then previous one with the next one
 * so it will be : "hello worl", same goes here, if we find that we are at the end of the line ? no we call it again 
 * and join all the previous one,
 * we repeat this untill we are at the end of the line and 
 * finnaly : we update our complete line and return the size of line we read
